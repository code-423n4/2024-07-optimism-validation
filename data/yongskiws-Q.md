## Attacker can cause a DOS during claimCredit and _payoutBond by intentionally reverting 

It performs a low-level call to the _claimant and _recipient to transfer and reverses the transaction if the transfer fails. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue, meaning it must process earlier requests before handling later ones.


An attacker could exploit this by intentionally triggering a revert on the receive() function. This action would cause _payoutBond() and claimCredit() to revert and block the entire queue.


Impact: This can result in a Denial of Service for all requests, thereby locking users’ funds.

Recommended Mitigation: Consider using the Pull-over-Push pattern. Reference: https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html


``` solidity 
// PreimageOracle.sol

    function _payoutBond(address _claimant, uint256 _uuid, address _to) internal {
        // Pay out the bond to the claimant.
        uint256 bond = proposalBonds[_claimant][_uuid];
        proposalBonds[_claimant][_uuid] = 0;
        (bool success,) = _to.call{ value: bond }("");
        if (!success) revert BondTransferFailed();
    }


// FaultDisputeGame.sol
    function claimCredit(address _recipient) external {
        // Remove the credit from the recipient prior to performing the external call.
        uint256 recipientCredit = credit[_recipient];
        credit[_recipient] = 0;

        // Revert if the recipient has no credit to claim.
        if (recipientCredit == 0) revert NoCreditToClaim();

        // Try to withdraw the WETH amount so it can be used here.
        WETH.withdraw(_recipient, recipientCredit);

        // Transfer the credit to the recipient.
        (bool success,) = _recipient.call{ value: recipientCredit }(hex"");
        if (!success) revert BondTransferFailed();
    }
    
```


## initLPP, addLeavesLPP, and challengeLPP, An attacker can send transactions to the initLPP and addLeavesLPP functions repeatedly, causing a reentrancy attack, such as _uuid 
for example invalid _uuid (0xffffffff) and invalid _partOffset (0xdeadbeef) values ​​to the initLPP, addLeavesLPP, and challengeLPP functions

Attackers can send invalid _uuid and _partOffset values, thereby causing data corruption in the contract.
