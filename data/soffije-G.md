## Vulnerabilities in the Contract

### **Potential Gas Inefficiency**
**Issue:**
The `findLatestGames` function performs a reverse linear search which could be gas-inefficient for large arrays.

**Impact:**
High gas usage for large arrays can make the function expensive to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

**Solution:**
Consider more optimized data structures or indexing methods to handle large arrays efficiently. In the current context, we can limit the search scope or batch process to manage gas costs.
